## 💡 Features

- 💧 **Automated Watering**: Water pump activates based on soil moisture levels.
- 🌡️ **Environmental Monitoring**: Real-time temperature and humidity sensing (DHT11).
- 🌱 **Soil Moisture Detection**: Monitors soil moisture using a dedicated sensor.
- 📊 **LCD Display**: Shows live sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motor status).
- ⚙️ **Efficient Water Usage**: Reduces water wastage through targeted irrigation.
- 💰 **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes manual labor costs associated with irrigation.
